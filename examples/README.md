There are a growing number of examples in this folder, and you're welcome to explore any of them as you like. However,
if you wanted to know the simplest ones to start with, they are:

* `text` (basic text rendering)
* `keys` (basic keypress handling)
* `input` (basic input handling)
* `anim` (basic animation example)
* `extend` (demonstration of using extension functions with Kotter)

To run any example project in your terminal, you can issue the following commands:

```bash
$ cd $demo # e.g. "cd text"
$ ../../gradlew installDist
$ ./build/install/$demo/bin/$demo 
# e.g. "./build/install/text/bin/text"
```
