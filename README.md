# Konsole

```kotlin
konsole {
    textLine("Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)")
    text("> $input");
    blinkingCursor()
}.onInputEntered {
    if (input.toLowercase().startsWith("y")) {
        p { textLine("""\(^o^)/""") }
    }
}
```

Konsole aims to be a relatively thin, Kotlin-idiomatic API that provides useful functionality for writing delightful
command line applications. It strives to keep things simple, providing a solution a bit more interesting than making
raw `println` calls but way less featured than something like _Java Curses_.

Specifically, this library helps with:

* Modifying console text in place
* Colors and text decoration (e.g. underline)
* Handling user input
* Support for animations

## Usage

### Basic

The following is equivalent to `println("Hello, World")`. In this simple case, it's definitely overkill!

```kotlin
konsole {
    textLine("Hello, World")
}.runOnce()
```

`konsole { ... }` defines a `KonsoleBlock` which, on its own, is inert. It needs to be run at least once to output text
to the console. Above, we use the `runOnce` method above to trigger this. As you might expect, `runOnce` will execute
the block once. At this time, the program is blocked until the render is finished running.

Only one block can run at a time, at which point it's active and dynamic. After it has finished running, it becomes
static history, at which point a new dynamic block is ready to take over.

Although above we just ran once, Konsole starts to show its strength when doing background work (or other async tasks
like waiting for user input) that cause the block to update several times, which we'll see many examples of in the
following sections.

### Background work

For background work, we introduce the `runUntilFinished` method, which takes a callback that is a suspend function that
is automatically run on a background thread for you. The konsole block, after rendering once, then waits for the
background work to finish. At that time, it rerenders one last time before relinquishing control.

```kotlin
var result: Int? = null
konsole {
    text("Calculating... ")
    if (result != null) {
        textLine("Done! Result = $result")
    }
}.runUntilFinished {
    result = doNetworkFetchAndExpensiveCalculation()
}
```

You can use it for something like a progress bar. Note here we introduce use of the `rerender` method, which triggers
a block render before the background work has had a chance to finish:

```kotlin
const val BAR_LENGTH = 100
var percent = 0
konsole {
    text("[")
    val numComplete = percent * BAR_LENGTH
    for (val i in 0 until BAR_LENGTH) {
        text(if (i < numComplete) "*" else "-")
    }
    text("]")
}.runUntilFinished {
    // rerenderOnFinished not required in this case because we call it manually
    rerenderOnFinished = false
    while (percent < 100) {
        delay(100)
        percent += 1
        rerender()
    }
}
```

A common pattern is for the `runUntilFinished` block to wait for some sort of signal before finishing, e.g. in response
to some callback. A simple `CompletableDeffered<Unit>` is recommended for these cases:

```kotlin
val fileDownloader = FileDownloader("...")
fileDownloader.start()
konsole {
    text("Downloading files... ")
    if (fileDownloader.isFinished) {
        text("Done!")
    }
    textLine()
}.runUntilFinished {
    val finished = CompletableDeffered<Unit>()
    fileDownloader.onFinished += { finished.complete(Unit) }
    finished.await()
}
```

### Cursor

By default, Konsole doesn't display a cursor indicator, but you can easily do it yourself by calling `blinkingCursor`:

```kotlin
konsole {
    text("Cursor is here >>> ")
    blinkingCursor()
    text(" <<<")
}.runUntilFinished { /* ... */ }
```

When referenced, the cursor will cause the block to auto-render itself occasionally in order to repaint its state. 

The next section goes over reading in user input, which works well with the cursor.

### User input

Konsole consumes keypresses, so as the user types into the console, nothing will show up unless you intentionally print
it. You can easily do this using the `input` property, which contains the user's input typed so far (excluding control
characters):

```kotlin
konsole {
    // `input` is a property that contains the user's input typed so far in
    // this konsole block. If your block references it, the block is
    // automatically rerendered when it changes.
    text("Please enter your name: $input")
    blinkingCursor()
}.runUntilFinished { /* ... */ }
```

You can intercept input as it is typed in using the `onInputChanged` event:

```kotlin
konsole {
    text("Please enter your name: $input")
    blinkingCursor()
}.runUntilFinished {
    onInputChanged = { 
        // Reject invalid characters!
        input = input.filter { it.isLetter() } 
    }
    /* ... */
}
```

You can also use the `lastInput` property to return your input to the previous state. 

```kotlin
konsole {
    text("Please enter your name: $input")
    blinkingCursor()
}.runUntilFinished {
    onInputChanged = { 
        if (input.any { !it.isLetter() }) {
            input = lastInput
        }
    }
    /* ... */
}
```

You can also use `onInputEntered`. This will be triggered whenever the user presses the ENTER key.

```kotlin
lateinit var name: String
konsole {
    text("Please enter your name: $input")
    blinkingCursor()
}.runUntilFinished {
    val nameEntered = CompletableDeferred<Unit>()
    onInputChanged = { input = input.filter { it.isLetter() } }
    onInputEntered = { name = input; nameEntered.complete(Unit) }
    nameEntered.await()
}
```

Putting everything together, let's tweak the example from the beginning of this README:

```kotlin
var wantsToLearn = false
konsole {
    textLine("Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)")
    text("> $input")
    blinkingCursor() 
    if ("yes".startsWith(input)) {
        grey {
            text("yes".substringAfter(input))
        }
    }
    if (wantsToLearn) {
        p {
            textLine("""\(^o^)/""")
        }
    }
}.runUntilFinished {
    val finished = CompletableDeffered<Unit>()
    onInputChanged = {
        val isValid = ("yes".startsWith(input) || "no".startsWithInput(input))
        if (!isValid) {
            input = lastInput
        }
    }
    onInputEntered = {
        if ("yes".startsWith(input)) {
            input = "yes" // Update the input to make it feel like we autocompleted their answer
            wantsToLearn = true
        }
        finished.complete(Unit)
    }
    finished.await()
}
```

This will cause the following to be printed to the console:

```bash
Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)
> |y|es
```

After the user presses "ye":

```bash
Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)
> ye|s|
```

And after the user presses enter:

```bash
Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)
> yes

\(^o^)/

(Next line of text would go here...)
```

A common situation in a console is responding to bad input.

```kotlin
val VALID_ANSWERS = setOf("yes", "no")
var errorMessage: String? = null
konsole {
    text("Would you like to learn Konsole? (Y/n)")
    text("> $input");
    blinkingCursor()
    if (errorMessage != null) {
        newLine()
        red { textLine(errorMessage) }
    }
}.runUntilFinished {
    onInputEntered = {
        if (!VALID_ANSWERS.any { it.startsWith(input) }) {
            errorMessage = "Please try again. Reason: \"$input\" was invalid"
            rerender()
        }
        else if ("yes".startsWith(evt.input)) { /* ... */ }
    }
    /* ... */
}
```

### Text Effects

You can call color methods directly:

```kotlin
konsole {
    green(layer = BG)
    red() // defaults to FG layer
    text("Hello")
    clearColor() // defaults to FG layer
    text(" ")
    blue()
    text("World")
    clearColor()
    clearColor(layer = BG)
    // ^ You could also have used clearColors() instead of calling clearColor twice
}.runOnce()
```

or you can use scoped helper versions that handle clearing colors for you automatically at the end of their block:

```kotlin
konsole {
    green(layer = BG) {
        red {
            text("Hello")
        }
        text(" ")
        blue {
            text("World")
        }
    }
}.runOnce()
```

You could do this yourself manually, using the `scopedState` method. What this does is creates a new scope within which
any state will be automatically discarded after it ends. This is what the scoped color methods are doing for you under
the hood, actually.

```kotlin
konsole {
    scopedState {
        green(layer = BG)
        scopedState {
            red()
            text("Hello")
        }
        text(" ")
        scopedState {
            blue()
            text("World")
        }
    }
}.runOnce()
```

While `scopedState` is quite verbose for the single color case, it can be useful if you want to change the foreground
and background colors at the same time:

```kotlin
konsole {
    scopedState {
        red()
        blue(BG)
        text("Hello world")
    }
}.runOnce()
```

### State

To reduce the chance of introducing unexpected bugs later, state changes (like colors) will be localized to the current
`konsole` block only:

```kotlin
konsole {
    blue(BG)
    red()
    text("This text is red on blue")
}.runOnce()

konsole {
    text("This text is rendered using default colors")
}.runOnce()
```

### Animations

You can easily create custom animations, by implementing the `KonsoleAnimation` interface and then instantiating an
animation instance from it:

```kotlin
val SPINNER = object : KonsoleAnimation(Duration.ofMillis(250)) {
    override val frames = arrayOf("\\", "|", "/", "-") 
}

var finished = false
val spinner = SPINNER.createInstance()
konsole {
    if (!finished) {
        animation(spinner)
    }
    else {
        text("âœ“")
    }
    text(" Searching for files...")
    if (finished) {
        text(" Done!")
    }
    testLine()
}.runUntilFinished {
    doExpensiveFileSearching()
    finished = true
}
```

If it's a one-use animation that you don't want to share as a template, you can create the instance directly of course:

```kotlin
val spinner = object : KonsoleAnimation(Duration.ofMillis(250)) {
    override val frames = arrayOf("\\", "|", "/", "-") 
}.createInstance()
```

Here's a way to create the progress bar from earlier using animations:

```kotlin
val PROGRESS_BAR = object : KonsoleAnimation(Duration.MAX_VALUE) {
    override val frames = arrayOf(
        "[----------]",
        "[*---------]",
        "[**--------]",
        "[***-------]",
        "[****------]",
        "[*****-----]",
        "[******----]",
        "[*******---]",
        "[********--]",
        "[*********-]",
        "[**********]",
    )
}

val progressBar = PROGRESS_BAR.createInstance()
konsole {
    animation(progressBar)
}.runUntilFinished {
    while (progressBar.advance()) {
        delay(100)
    }
}
```

## Advanced

### Thread Affinity

The experience of using Konsole is essentially single-threaded. Anytime you make a call to run a Konsole block, no
matter which thread it is called from, a single thread ultimately handles the work of rendering the block. At the same
time, if you attempt to call `konsole` while another Konsole block is already running, an exception is thrown.

I made this decision so that:

* I don't have to worry about multiple Konsole blocks println'ing at the same time - who likes clobbered text?
* Konsole does a bunch of tricks moving the terminal cursor around and setting color, etc. states, which would fail
horribly if multiple Konsole blocks tried doing this at the same time.
* Konsole embraces the idea of a dynamic, active block trailed by a bunch of static history. If two dynamic blocks
wanted to be active at the same time, what would that even mean?

In practice, I expect this decision won't be an issue for most users. Command line apps are expected to have a main flow
anyway -- ask the user a question, do some work, then ask another question, etc. It is expected that a user won't ever
even need to call `konsole` from more than one thread. It is hoped that the `konsole { ... }.runUntilFinished { ... }`
pattern is powerful enough for most (all?) cases.

### Virtual Terminal

It's not guaranteed that every user's command line setup supports ANSI codes. For example, debugging this project with
IntelliJ as well as Gradle are two such environments where functionality is limited! According to many online reports,
Windows is also a big offender here.

Konsole will attempt to detect if your console does not support the features it uses, and if not, it will open up a
fake virtual terminal backed by Swing. This workaround gives us better cross-platform support.

To modify the logic to ALWAYS open the virtual terminal, you can write the following somewhere in your program before
you start using Konsole:

```kotlin
DefaultTerminalIoProvider = { VirtualTerminalIo() }
```

### Why Not Compose?

Konsole's API is inspired by Compose, in that it has a core block which gets rerun for you automatically as necessary
without you having to worry about it. Why not just use Compose directly?

In fact, this is exactly what [Jake Wharton's Mosaic](https://github.com/JakeWharton/mosaic) is doing. I tried using it
first but ultimately decided against it before deciding to write Konsole, for the following reasons:

* Compose is tightly tied to the current Kotlin compiler version, which means if you are targeting a particular
version of the Kotlin language, you can easily see the dreaded error message: `This version (x.y.z) of the Compose
Compiler requires Kotlin version a.b.c but you appear to be using Kotlin version d.e.f which is not known to be
compatible.`
  * Using Kotlin v1.3 for some reason? You're out of luck. 
  * I suspect this issue with Compose will improve over time, but for the present, it still seems like a non-Compose
  approach could be useful to many.

* Compose is great for rendering a whole, interactive UI, but console printing is often two parts: the active part that
the user is interacting with, and the history, which is static. To support this with Compose, you'd need to manage the
history list yourself and keep appending to it, and it was while thinking about an API that addressed this limitation
that I envisioned Konsole.
