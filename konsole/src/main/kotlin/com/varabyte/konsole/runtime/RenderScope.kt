/**
 * A scope which represents a single render pass inside a Konsole block.
 *
 * So for this simple, never-ending example:
 *
 * ```
 * var count by KonsoleVar(0)
 * konsole {
 *   textLine("Count: $count")
 * }.run {
 *   while (true) {
 *     delay(250)
 *     ++count
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * the concept of the block itself is represented by the [KonsoleBlock] class, while each render pass (triggered every
 * 250ms, above) is passed a new instance of this class.
 *
 * Despite this class's transient state, it often works with the underlying block, offering a limited subset of passthru
 * functionality that simply delegates the operation to the underlying block.
