/**
 * A poor man's reimplementation of the JVM ReentrantLock class.
 *
 * Programmer's note: I am very nervous about this. This is an experiment to see if I can port my JVM library over to
 * multiplatform, and Kotter makes use of reentrant locks, which are otherwise not provided for the Kotlin/Native
 * target. Unfortunately, some Kotter APIs expose reentrant locks which means this class is now exposed to users.
 * Fortunately, it's not expected most users will ever interact with it, unless they are extending Kotter, which is
 * kind of advanced. For now, we'll experiment with this and see if it doesn't seem to cause any immediate concerns.
