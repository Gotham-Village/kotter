/**
 * A thread-safe package of key/value pairs.
 *
 * You should register data using a predefined [Key] object. When registering values, an optional dispose block can be
 * specified at the same time, which will automatically be triggered when the block is done running.
 *
 * This data will be tied to a [Lifecycle]. You must call [start] with a lifecycle first before keys tied to that
 * lifecycle can be added. Afterwards, call [stop] to remove all keys with the matching lifecycle and deactivate it.
 *
 * Note: Although the class is designed to be thread safe, some calls (which are noted with warnings) can expose values
 * to you which are no longer covered by the lock. Those should only be used to fetch immutable or thread-safe values.
