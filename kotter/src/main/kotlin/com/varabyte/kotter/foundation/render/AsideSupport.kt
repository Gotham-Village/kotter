/**
 * An aside block is essentially a `section`-lite block. It looks similar to one, but with a few less features (e.g. the
 * `input` method doesn't work on it), and it only ever runs once.
 *
 * The aside block is prepended in front of the active block, and this is useful if the main active area (that is
 * repainting / refreshing constantly) wants to generate additional text as a side effect (e.g. a compiler that
 * generates a history warnings and errors as it runs).
